## Approach-1

### Solution:
Brute-force approach.
```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                firstNumber = nums[i]
                secondNumber = target - firstNumber
                if nums[j] == secondNumber:
                    return [i, j]
```

### Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`, where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the algorithm uses a nested loop to compare every possible pair of numbers in the list.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)`, which is constant. This is because the algorithm only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.

## Approach-2
### Solution:
This is an optimized solution for the two-sum problem that uses a hash table to store the indices of the numbers in the input list.

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        lookUp = {}
        for idx in range(len(nums)):
            diff = target - nums[idx]
            if diff in lookUp:
                return [lookUp[diff], idx]
            else:
                lookUp[nums[idx]] = idx
```

### Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the algorithm performs a single pass over the list and checks if the complement of the current number is already in the hash table, which takes constant time on average.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is also `O(n)`, because in the worst case scenario, all the numbers in the input list are distinct and therefore the hash table would need to store all n numbers and their indices.

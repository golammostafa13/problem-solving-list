## Approach-1

### Solution:
This is a solution for the subsequence problem, which checks whether the string `s` is a subsequence of the string `t`.

The algorithm uses two pointers to iterate through both strings simultaneously. It starts by comparing the first character of `s` with the first character of `t`. If they match, it moves both pointers to the next character in each string. If they don't match, it moves only the pointer for `t` to the next character.
```py
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        tIdx = 0
        sIdx = 0
        if (len(s) == 0):
            return True
        while(tIdx < len(t) and sIdx < len(s)):
            if(s[sIdx] == t[tIdx]):
                sIdx += 1
                tIdx += 1
            else:
                tIdx += 1
        return sIdx == len(s)
```

### Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the input string `t`. This is because the algorithm performs a single pass over `t`, and in the worst case scenario, it needs to iterate through all the characters of `t`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)`, which is constant. This is because the algorithm only uses two pointers and a fixed amount of memory to store the indices of the current characters in `s` and `t`.
